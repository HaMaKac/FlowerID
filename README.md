Smart Grocery List is a mobile app that uses computer vision to simplify the grocery shopping experience for users. The app scans grocery receipts and automatically adds items to a shopping list, categorizes them, and suggests recipes based on the ingredients.

Receipt scanning: Users can take a picture of their grocery receipt using the app, and the app will scan the receipt and automatically add items to a shopping list.
Categorization: The app categorizes items (e.g., produce, dairy, meats, etc.) to make shopping more efficient.
Recipe suggestions: The app uses machine learning algorithms to suggest recipes based on the ingredients on the shopping list.
